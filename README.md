# Readership-Word-Cloud
<b>Summary: </b> The goal of this project is to create a native JavaScript word cloud that has a continuous scrolling effect across the desired container.<br>
<br>
<b>Data:</b> The data (and inspiration) being used is a compilation of readership demographics for my paper, <a href="https://digitalcommons.spu.edu/honorsprojects/181/">Using Deep Neural Networks to Classify Astronomical Images</a> (the project is available <a href="https://github.com/admacpherson/Astronomical-Identification-ML">here</a>)<br>
<br>
<b>Status:</b> This project is in an intermediate stage. There are still several bugs to be worked out:<br>
✅Data<br>
✅Environment setup<br>
✅Random word selection<br>
✅Word cloud generation<br>
✅Color coding<br>
✅Modularity<br>
✅Scrolling effect<br>
✅Continuous generation<br>
✅Prevent DOM buildup<br>
❌Seamless scrolling<br>
❌Dynamic container testing<br>
